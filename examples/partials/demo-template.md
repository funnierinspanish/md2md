Welcome to **{% project_name %}**!

This template demonstrates:
- Variable substitution: {% feature_name %}
- Default values: {% optional_var || "default value" %}

Created by: {% author %}

### Internal Section: {% internal_section_name || "Additional Details" %}

This shows how you can have variable-driven titles anywhere in the content, separate from the main title that gets added by the `title` attribute of the !include statement.
