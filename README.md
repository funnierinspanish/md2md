# md2md

A powerful Markdown processor that supports include directives and code snippet inclusion for reusable content composition.

## Overview

md2md allows you to compose documents from reusable markdown partials and code snippets using include directives. This enables you to:

- **Reuse content** across multiple documents
- **Include code files** with syntax highlighting and line selection
- **Maintain consistency** in documentation
- **Organize content** into modular, reusable pieces
- **Process files individually** or in batch mode

## Features

- üîó **Include directives** - Compose documents from reusable partials
- ÔøΩ **Code snippet inclusion** - Include code files with syntax highlighting
- ÔøΩüìÅ **Batch processing** - Process entire directories at once  
- üñ•Ô∏è  **Interactive TUI** - Beautiful terminal interface for monitoring progress
- ü§ñ **CI/automation mode** - Non-interactive processing for pipelines
- üõ°Ô∏è **Force mode** - Automatic overwrite and directory creation
- üìä **Detailed reporting** - Comprehensive processing statistics
- ‚úÖ **Input/Output validation** - Enforces consistent file/directory types

## Two Main Directive Types

- **`!include()`** - Include markdown partials with optional variables and titles
- **`!codesnippet()`** - Include code files with syntax highlighting and line selection

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Process a single file with partials
md2md input.md -p partials -o output.md

# Include code snippets with syntax highlighting
# Use !codesnippet(file.rs, lang="rust") in your markdown

# Batch process directory
md2md src-docs -p partials -o output-docs --batch

# CI mode with automatic overwrite
md2md src-docs -p partials -o output-docs --batch --ci --force
```

## Directive Syntax

md2md supports two types of directives for content inclusion:

### Include Directives

Use include directives to include markdown partials:

#### Basic Include

```markdown
!include(your-partial.md)
```

#### Include with Title

Add an automatic title to the included content:

```markdown
!include(your-partial.md, title="Section Title")
!include(your-partial.md, title="Section Title", title-level=2)
```

#### Include with Variables

Pass variables to be substituted in the included content:

```markdown
!include(your-partial.md, values=[variable_name="Value", another_var="Another Value"])
```

#### Combined Usage

```markdown
!include(your-partial.md, title="Getting Started", title-level=2, values=[project_name="MyProject", author="John Doe"])
```

#### Variable Syntax in Partials

Within your partial files, use this syntax for variables:

```markdown
# Welcome to {% project_name %}!

Created by: {% author %}

Optional with default: {% optional_var || "default value" %}
```

### Code Snippet Directives

Use codesnippet directives to include code files with syntax highlighting:

#### Basic Code Inclusion

```markdown
!codesnippet(src/main.rs, lang="rust")
```

#### Line Range Selection

```markdown
!codesnippet(utils.py, lang="python", start=10, end=25)
!codesnippet(config.js, lang="javascript", end=15)
!codesnippet(helpers.py, lang="python", start=20)
```

#### Without Language

```markdown
!codesnippet(data.txt)
```

### Path Resolution

Both include and codesnippet directives follow the same path resolution rules:

1. **Partials directory** - Plain filenames are resolved relative to the partials directory (`-p` flag)
2. **Relative paths** - Paths starting with `../` are resolved relative to the current file
3. **Absolute paths** - Paths starting with `/` are used as-is

## Example

Given this file structure:

```text
examples/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ source-documents/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mixed-demo.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ partials/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ header.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ footer.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-code/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hello.rs
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example.py
```

Your `docs/api.md` can include partials and code:

```markdown
!include(header.md)

# API Documentation

!codesnippet(../test-code/hello.rs, lang="rust")

Your main content here...

!include(footer.md)
```

Process with:

```bash
md2md docs/api.md -p partials -o output/api.md
```

Yielding:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    let x = 42;
    let y = x * 2;
    println!("Result: {}", y);
    
    if x > 0 {
        println!("x is positive");
    }
}
```

## What happens to surrounding content?

As you can see, nothing breaks!

## CLI Reference

```bash
md2md [OPTIONS] <INPUT_PATH>

Arguments:
  <INPUT_PATH>  The source file or directory to be processed

Options:
  -p, --partials-path <PARTIALS>    The directory containing partials [default: partials]
  -o, --output-path <OUTPUT>        Output path (file or directory) [default: out]
  -b, --batch                       Process directories recursively (batch mode)
  -v, --verbose                     Verbose output
      --ci                          Disable TUI interface (use simple console output)
  -f, --force                       Force overwrite existing files and create directories
  -h, --help                        Print help
  -V, --version                     Print version
```

## Input/Output Validation

md2md enforces consistent input/output types:

- **File input** ‚Üí **File output**: `input.md` ‚Üí `output.md`
- **Directory input** ‚Üí **Directory output**: `src-docs/` ‚Üí `output-docs/`
- Use trailing slash (`/`) to explicitly indicate directory output
- Files without extensions are allowed as output for file input

## Validation Examples

```bash
# ‚úÖ Valid: File ‚Üí File
md2md input.md -p partials -o output.md

# ‚úÖ Valid: Directory ‚Üí Directory  
md2md src-docs -p partials -o output-docs --batch

# ‚úÖ Valid: Directory ‚Üí Directory (explicit)
md2md src-docs -p partials -o output-docs/ --batch

# ‚ùå Invalid: File ‚Üí Directory
md2md input.md -p partials -o output-dir/

# ‚ùå Invalid: Directory ‚Üí File
md2md src-docs -p partials -o output.md --batch
```

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for comprehensive demonstrations of md2md features:

```bash
# Process include examples
md2md examples/source-documents/demo.md -p examples/partials -o output/demo.md

# Process code snippet examples  
md2md examples/source-documents/codesnippet-demo.md -p examples/partials -o output/codesnippet-demo.md

# Process mixed directives
md2md examples/source-documents/mixed-directives.md -p examples/partials -o output/mixed.md

# Batch process directory
md2md examples/source-documents -p examples/partials -o output-docs --batch
```

## Architecture

md2md processes files through these steps:

1. **Parse** input files for include and codesnippet directives
2. **Resolve** partial and code file paths according to resolution rules  
3. **Include** partial content and code snippets recursively (supports nested includes)
4. **Process** variable substitution in partials
5. **Write** processed output to destination

The tool supports both single-file processing and batch directory processing with comprehensive error handling and progress reporting.

## Terminology Guide

### Partials vs Templates

**md2md** uses the term "partials" to describe reusable content pieces, although the CLI flag remains `--templates-path` for backward compatibility.

### Partials

- **Definition**: Reusable pieces of content that can be included in multiple documents
- **Examples**: Headers, footers, common sections, shared content blocks
- **Usage**: Include directives like `!include (header.md)` pull in the content of partials

### Templates (in broader context)

- **Definition**: Structural layouts that define the overall format of documents
- **Examples**: HTML page layouts, document skeletons with placeholders
- **md2md approach**: We compose documents from partials rather than filling template placeholders

## Why "Partials"?

The content pieces in md2md are:

1. **Self-contained** - Complete markdown content that can stand alone
1. **Reusable** - Used across multiple documents
1. **Composable** - Combined to build larger documents
1. **Content-focused** - Contain actual content rather than structural placeholders

This aligns with the "partial" concept used in many templating systems where partials are reusable content components.

## CLI Compatibility

The CLI flag remains `--templates-path` for backward compatibility, but conceptually these are partials directories containing reusable content pieces.
